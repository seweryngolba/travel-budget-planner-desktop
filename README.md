# Trip Planner Web Application

**Description:**

The Trip Planner is a web application that helps users calculate the total budget required for a trip. Users can input various expenses, such as flights, hotel, food, transport, visa, internet, attractions, and souvenirs. The application then calculates the total cost and provides a breakdown of individual expenses.

**Demo Website:**

You can try out the Trip Planner web application by visiting the demo website hosted on Netlify:

[Demo page](https://travel-budget-s-golba.netlify.app/)

Please note that the demo website is optimized for desktop use. For the best experience, we recommend accessing it from a desktop or laptop computer with a larger screen size.

**Platform:**

The Trip Planner web application is designed and optimized for desktops. It provides the best user experience when accessed from a desktop or laptop computer with a larger screen size. While the application may work on smaller devices like tablets and some larger smartphones, it is recommended to use a desktop for the optimal viewing and interaction experience.

**Responsiveness:**

Please note that the Trip Planner is not designed as a responsive web application, meaning it does not automatically adjust its layout and design to fit different screen sizes and orientations. As a result, it may not provide an optimal experience on mobile devices with smaller screens.

For the best experience, I recommend using the Trip Planner on a desktop or laptop computer with a screen size of at least 1024 pixels wide.

1. Fill in the following information in the left section of the web page:

   - Number of travelers (`Number of travelers` input): Enter the number of people traveling. It must be at least 1.
